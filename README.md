## A rusty implementation of TAK server
Inspired by [TAKY](https://github.com/tkuester/taky) and [FTS](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTakServer), but snake is not my friend.

Used for [ATAK](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atakmap.app.civ&hl=en_US) 
and [iTAK](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/itak/id1561656396) as streaming backend.

Why TAK in rust? Because why not? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Let's see how far I can go without getting insane.
